          <p>I currently reside in Delhi and work at a bank. I had an affair with a colleague, and we ended up having children together. We wanted to stay together as a family, but her husband found out about our relationship and gave her a divorce. I don't want to leave her, nor do I want to tell my family about this situation. What should I do?</p>

          <p>I work in an IT company in Delhi. Whenever I used to go to the office, my wife would send our children to the park, and someone would come to our house. My neighbor informed me about this, and I asked my wife about it. She denied it and accused me of doubting her. So, one day, pretending to go to the office, I sat at a shop far from home. That same boy came and entered my house. I waited for a while and found out that he was having a meal there. I haven't filed for divorce for the sake of our children, but I did inform his family about this incident. It has caused me a lot of stress..</p>

          <p>i am 37 years old women,and  live in Masko ,My husband betrayed my trust by sharing me with his friends. I was married at the young age of 20 when I was still a vulnerable and naive girl. Due to my family's financial struggles, I was forced into a marriage with a much older man. He would give me sleeping pills at night to sedate me while his friends would come and engage in inappropriate acts with me. This continued for several years until one day I discovered the truth. From that day onwards, I refused to go near my husband and eventually filed for divorce. I have two children, but I am unsure if they belong to my husband or someone else. Currently, I reside in peris, trying to rebuild my life and find solace after the traumatic experiences I have endured.</p>

          <p>hello world i live in bangkok and I am a business person, and I have four siblings. When I was 15 years old, my father passed away, and the responsibility of the entire household fell upon me. For several years, I pursued my studies while working hard to support my family, including arranging my siblings' marriages and building a better home for everyone.

However, being the elder one after my father's demise did not sit well with everyone. Some decisions I had to make for the family were considered strict and unpopular among the household members. Despite enduring challenging times, my relationships with everyone have suffered, and now I wonder how to mend those bonds and bring harmony back into our home.Advice me world.</p>

          <p>Hello, I live in Kolkata, India. When I was 10 years old, I visited a relative's place, and that night, I was made to sleep near their son, who was 10 years older than me. He did something inappropriate, which has been haunting my mind ever since. I couldn't forget that day and couldn't share it with anyone. But this platform has given me the opportunity to finally express my thoughts. Before I leave this world, I want to share this incident with the entire world as a cautionary tale, so that parents can protect their children from such individuals.
